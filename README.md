# plate-platform-optimizer

- SQL database
Lifter and which bar (0 for m, 1 for f)
Exceptions for relationships aka who works well (jason, lisa) who doesn't (me, dorian or ronnie, jay)
Link PR to exercises, exercises links to (floor, block, rack, power rack)
Spots 1 through 6 which have attributes (1 or 0 for power rack, 1 or 0 for closeness to blocks, and all platforms have floor and rack)

- Training bar plate optimizer
Optimizer 1
Which plates based on what plates are available is best for everyone to get the weight they need
we've got 4 pairs of red plates, x amount of blue plates, etc.
Everyone present is doing exercise 1, how to distribute plates
who is lifting on the same bar?

- Spot optimizer for who should go where
Optimizer 2
Weights being lifted
Relationships
Exercise correlation (if the weights are close enough then can both be lifting from the floor or rack)

Should I use C or Python or Julia for the calculation?

I am thinking most likely Python for ease of use and the using with SQL.
